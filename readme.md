# Stellar Evolution Visualizer



### Description
Made in the Godot engine.

Visualize stellar evolution with a MrPlasma/Algol style timeline!

The visualizer pulls out data from the output .csv file made using the Python script/exe file.

Orbits are optional and are mainly used to show scale.

More information [here](https://worldbuildingpasta.blogspot.com/2022/11/an-apple-pie-from-scratch-part-ii.html?m=1).

#### Notes
- Thermal pulses (expanding/shrinking) of the star during the asymptotic giant branch is not visualized.
- Evolutionary stage names may be applied to the wrong stars (e.g. Wolf-Rayet star for a 0.5 mass red dwarf.)
- Orbital expansion may be inaccurate.
